# Overview

This is a project I completed in an attempt to learn Typescript during a two-week period of school.  I understand that many companies use typescript so I wanted to learn what was so powerful about it.  For this project I simply connected to an API and display some information from it onto a web page, according to what the user enters into the typing field.  I felt I needed additional practice with API calls so this was a good way to get two birds with one stone.

I learned a lot about typescript in this project.  I expected to find it was very similar to Javascript, and it is, but with a few differences I'm not really sure about the reason of.  I know I still have quite a lot to learn about typescript, but this was a great project to get me started.  Here is a short video demonstrating the software and running through the code:

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code for this assignment.  Everything I wrote was in Typescript and HTML, with a small JSON file to help configure the typescript.  There is also a js file that I made (to connect the typescript and HTML) with this terminal command: tsc Pokedex.ts

# Useful Websites

I found the typescript documentation very useful for working in a few plases wehre typescript and javascript were found to differ.  ChatGPT also helped with a lot of the syntax errors I made regarding function calling.

# Future Work

Here are a few more elements I'd like to add in the future.

- Display more data from the API
- Organize the web page better and apply some CSS to make it prettier
- Display images
